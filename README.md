### Checklist

- [x] **TASK 2** : Set Up Version Control - Set up the folder you created previously to be a Git repository `git init`, `git add .` `git -m commit "Initial commit"` - need to set up a remote origin and push the initial files to a repository on GitHub. At Source Control menu `Push Branch`, name on it as repository name.
- [x] **TASK 3** : Build the Business Component - The component will represent how a business (a restaurant) in Ravenous will be formatted and styled. Each `Business` component should display an `image`, `name`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`, `category`, `rating`, and `review count`.
- [ ] **TASK 4** : Add a Sample Business - For the Business component, create a hardcoded business that can be used to generate a list of fake businesses and simulate the websiteâ€™s functionality.
